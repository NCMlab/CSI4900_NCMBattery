You are invited to participate in a research study on memory and aging. We ask that you read this form and ask any
questions that you may have before you agree to be in this study.
</p>

<h3>PURPOSE OF STUDY</h3>
The study will measure performance limits on different cognitive tasks. The overall aim is to test whether older
adults respond in the same way as younger adults when all participants are matched based on their perceived
cognitive demands.

<h3>NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</h3>
If you agree to be in the study, you will be one of XXXX people who will be taking part in this research.

<h3>LOCATION OF THE STUDY</h3>
This study will take place virtually. We will use Zoom to talk with each other, and Google Chrome will be used to
complete the cognitive tasks and questionnaires.

<h3>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY</h3>
<ol>
<li>There will be one session lasting approximately two hours, given by a trained research assistant.</li>
<li>You will complete a series of tests of memory and cognitive function using a computer. Included in this time you
will complete short questionnaires about your date of birth, sex, ethnicity, education, handedness, and emotional
affect.</li>
<li>Finally, you will be asked to complete a series of longer questionnaires online using an email link provided at the
end of the session. These questionnaires will ask about your lifestyle and behaviors. This step takes approximately
30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
</ol>

<h3>RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</h3>
You may become fatigued while completing the cognitive tasks. If needed, we will take a break at any point during
the first session.
You may also feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions on the tests and questionnaires. While
completing the forms at home, you can skip any questions that you do not want to answer. You may skip answering
certain questions if you feel uncomfortable at any point. In the depression questionnaire, there is a question on
suicidality (with options that indicate a likelihood/potential of suicide). If you disclose a risk of suicide, you will be
contacted by the PI and provided with mental health resources and counselling services offered by the University
of Ottawa.

<h3>BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</h3>
There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study. The results of this study will allow you to contribute to the
growing knowledge in the field of age-related cognitive decline that may provide considerable benefit to future
individuals and the greater scientific community.

<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
We will do all that we can to keep your personal information confidential. You will be assigned a specific code for
storage of your personal information in password-protected files on a computer stored in a locked room. Therefore,
data will be stored by code, not by name. This data will be available to only Dr. Steffener and his trained research
assistants and student researchers for their theses. Study data may be looked at by the Research Ethics Board
and/or the Research Quality Associate for the purpose of quality assurance. Any publications, or presentations
based on this research will not use your name or identify you. All data will be destroyed after 10 years.
