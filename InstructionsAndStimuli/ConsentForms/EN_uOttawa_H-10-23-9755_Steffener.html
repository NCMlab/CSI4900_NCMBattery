You are invited to participate in a research study on cognition and aging. We ask that you read this form carefully. 

<h3>PURPOSE OF STUDY</h3>
The purpose of this study is to test and validate remotely administered tests of memory and cognitive function. All assessments will be administered via a web browser and automatically scored. Test results will be reviewed and compared against previously conducted studies performed in person. Successful demonstration of accurate remotely assessed tests of memory and cognitive function is an important step toward building telemedicine capabilities. The data will also be used in the context of student theses.

<h3>NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</h3>
If you agree to be in the study, you will be one of 120 people taking part in this research.

<h3>LOCATION OF THE STUDY</h3>
You may perform this study at any location of your choice.

<h3>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY</h3> 
There will be a one-hour-long session. During this time, you will complete a  questionnaire about your date of birth, sex, education, and handedness. You will then complete a series of cognitive tasks requiring you to listen to spoken stimuli, view visual stimuli, and make spoken responses. Audio recordings will occur for your spoken responses. Finally, you will be asked to complete multiple questionnaires about mood, lifestyle, and behavior. Some of the questions are sensitive in nature (loneliness, depression).

<h3>RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY</h3>
You may also feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions. While completing the forms at home, you can skip any questions you do not want to answer. You may skip answering certain questions if you feel uncomfortable at any point.
